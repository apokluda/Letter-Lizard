%   - talk about history, popularity, insiprational languages, main features (eg
%     more traditional object oriented class-based design)
%   - talk about major projects using Python
%   - chosen for its popularity


\paragraph{JavaScript}
%   - "language of the Web"
%   - history, standartization process, insiprational languages, main features (eg
%     prototype-based inheritance), variable scoping (anti-feature), "everything
%     is an object"
%   - closures
%   - chosen for its ubiquitiy


\paragraph{Lua}
