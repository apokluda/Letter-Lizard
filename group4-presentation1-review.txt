some comments on the first presentation:
  - title: Letter Lizard
  - good presentation of project scope, very nicely illustrated using GUI mockups
  - reasonable choice of implementation languages (with some good motivation for the choices)
  - presentation slides did not cover some of the software engineering aspects of
  the project such as the division of work. This was addressed during the
  discussions that followed the presentation
  - useful discussion of possible extensions of the system
